        <p>My name is Teresa Isabel Huang, but I go by Billie, short for <em>Isabel</em>. 
        I'm a General Studies student at University of Missouri-Columbia, and I am a photographer and graphic designer. <br>
        I love skate, street, and fashion photography and hope to be a <em>paparazzo</em> or work for a hip hop culture oriented media publication one day. 
        I was born in Manila and moved to the states when I was six, and my dad has been a professor at <b>Mizzou</b> since 2014. 

        While I mostly do photos and design for my friend Andrew's his streetwear and skateboarding brand, Virginia Ave,
        I am also a freelancer and do concert photography and brand content for others. While most of my storytelling is done through photos and graphics, 
        none of it would be accessible without the help of the internet. I'm on Instagram as virginiaavemedia where you can find my work. <br>
        I am currently working on getting a website set up, which is why I am taking this course.
