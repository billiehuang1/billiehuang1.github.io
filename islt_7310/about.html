    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Billie Huang, a photographer and graphic designer. I'm a General Studies student at the University of Missouri in Columbia. 
        My images consist of skate, street, product, and fashion photography. In the future, I hope to be a paparazzo, personal photographer, 
        fashion photographer, or work for a media publication in the future. I was born in Manila and moved to the states when I was six. 
        I lived in Charlottesville, Virginia for seven years and have been based in Columbia, Missouri since my dad became a professor at Mizzou in 2014. 
        <br><br>
        While I started out doing photo and design for my friends, I am also a freelancer and do concert, 
        individual, and brand content for others. I help others make their stories accessible through the internet. 
        I'm on Instagram as mybloodyvirginiaave where you can find my work. In my free time, I like bass fishing, 
        playing Apex, and being annoying and chronically online.
