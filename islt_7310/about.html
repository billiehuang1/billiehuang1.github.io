    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm Billie Huang, a photographer and graphic designer. I'm a General Studies student at the University of Missouri, Columbia. I have done skate, street, product, and fashion photography and hope to be a paparazzo, personal photographer, fashion photographer, or work for a media publication in the future. I was born in Manila and moved to the states when I was six. I lived in Charlottesville, Virginia for seven years and have been based in Columbia, Missouri since my dad became a professor at Mizzou in 2014. 
        While I started out doing photo and design for my friends, I am also a freelancer and do concert, individual, and brand content for others. I help others tell their stories through visuals made accessible through the help of the internet and the Columbia community. I'm on Instagram as mybloodyvirginiaave where you can find my work. In my free time, I like bass fishing, playing Apex, and being annoying and chronically online.
