            <h3>Reflection</h3>

    <p>

    My dad got a Canon Powershot when I was around 11. It was a simple digital camera my family took everywhere. I was free to use it and took photos of whatever was around. In middle school, I went to a photography summer 
    camp where we learned to shoot and develop film in the darkroom, but I was more interested in digital equipment and editing software. In high school, my dad got an entry-level DSLR camera that I used to take photos of my friends. 
    I eventually joined yearbook during senior year of high school. The class gave opportunities to cover school events like sports games and band concerts.

    Having a camera in hand and a story to tell made me more outgoing. During my time at Mizzou, I didn’t really touch cameras until last fall of 2021. 
    I started taking photos of my friend Andrew’s skate and streetwear brand, Virginia Ave. Since November, I have found friends in local artists, musicians, content creators, etc. 
        <br><br>
    I like taking and sharing photos because they’re accessible - there’s no barrier to understanding them, and everyone relates to images differently. Medias sharing apps have made photography one of the most accessible mediums and I’ve been able to make new friendships through online communities.


            <br><br>

    The internet has also find new hobbies, inspiration, and entertainment.
    Some people I know through social media have influenced me to start screenprinting
    and making my own designs. Through screenprinting, I have found another way of
    self expression and an activity to connect to others and create a brand.
