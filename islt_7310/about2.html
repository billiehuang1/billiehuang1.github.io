        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>

            I'm Billie, a photographer and graphic designer. I am building a portfolio website to not only attract clients, but to showcase my work as well. I am imagining a landing/home page with bold links to sections of myself (Photo, Design, About, Contact). My website will allow friends and potential clients to browse through my portfolio, learn about me, my favorites, my influences. I want the viewer to get a good sense of my personality and style, but also see my work. As photos and design are more creative, the more individuality I express, the better. While I am being booked for photos, it’s mostly through word of mouth. I would like to expand my work and client base to a wider number of people around Columbia. This website would also be a good form of self expression and identity for myself, a good project to work on.
            (copied and pasted from my submission) My name is Teresa Isabel Huang, but I go by Billie, short for Isabel. I'm a General Studies student at University of Missouri-Columbia, and I am a photographer and graphic designer. I love skate, street, and fashion photography and hope to be a paparazzo or work for a hip hop culture oriented media publication one day. I was born in Manila and moved to the states when I was six, and my dad has been a professor at Mizzou since 2014. 
            While I mostly do photos and design for my friends, I am also a freelancer and do concert photography and brand content for others. While most of my storytelling is done through photos and graphics, none of it would be accessible without the help of the internet. I'm on Instagram as virginiaavemedia where you can find my work. I am currently working on getting a website set up, which is why I am taking this course.
