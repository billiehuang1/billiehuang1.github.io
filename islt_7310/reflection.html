        <h3>Reflection Summary</h3>

  
        <p class="firstparagraph">My dad got a Canon Powershot when I was around 11 years old. It was a slim, simple, and compact digital camera <br>
            that we took everywhere and a camera that I was free to use. I mostly took photos of random things around me, <br>
            like my stuffed animals and the trees outside. Living in Charlottesville, Virginia at the time, we also had a porch with a view of the <br>
            far-off Blue Ridge Mountains. The sunsets on the porch were gorgeous, but I was always frustrated the camera never <br>
            captured how the sunset and sky really looked. </p>

        <p class="reflectiontext">

            When I was in middle school, I attended a photography summer camp during the day. I learned how to shoot and develop film in the darkroom, but I was very <br>
            uninterested in shooting film. I used the digital equipment available and spent a lot of time editing and using whack effects in Photoshop. I thought the <br>
            analog film process was a bore and the end results weren’t worth the time. It’s funny that film photography has made a comeback over the past few years. <br>
            There’s a nostalgic look and feel to film lomography that isn’t available with phone cameras. I see a lot of disposable film camera apps that attempt to <br>
            mimic the feeling and look of cheap film, but nothing comes close. The return to obsolete technology and the waiting and developing photo process reflects <br>
            youth culture trend shifts towards nostalgia. It’s interesting to see it play out! </p>
            
        <p class="reflectiontext">
            In high school, my dad got an entry-level DSLR camera (Canon Rebel) for our family, but no one used it besides me. I was excited to have access to a real <br>
            body-and-lens camera and tried it out on my friends. One of the first people I took pictures of was my friend Reagan and her boyfriend at the time, Andrew. <br>
            They were typical photos from high schoolers in Columbia - we went to the Francis Quadrangle and I got shots of them walking and holding hands by The Columns. Tacky stuff!
        </p>
        
        <p class="reflectiontext">
            My senior year at Rock Bridge High, I joined yearbook. I hadn’t touched cameras for a couple years, but still used my eye and my iPhone camera. <br>
            Yearbook gave my friends and I access to professional equipment. I was able to cover events like sports games, jazz band concerts and school events, <br>
            but I was also able to use the equipment to do things like my friends’ senior photos and portrait photography. In yearbook we also had to write and interview <br>
            other students. Through this, I met a lot of people and friends. I loved how having a camera in my hand and a story to write made me a person of interest, even <br>
            though I was capturing other people. People are truer, better versions of themselves when a camera is present.
        </p>

        <p class="reflectiontext">
            During my time at Mizzou, I didn’t really touch cameras. I wanted to, I always wrote in my journal how I wish I had reasons to take photos or people who’s stories <br>
             I could help tell. I was a business student for 2.5 years and hated my classes. The content was mostly memorization and strategy, nothing I could be creative in. <br>
             I still had an interest in hip hop, movies, and working in entertainment media and content creation. I bought a handful of disposable cameras during my summers and <br>
             developed and looked back on my memories in the fall. 
        </p>

        <p class="reflectiontext">
            In November of 2021, I reached out to Andrew, one of the first people I had photographed. Andrew has a streetwear brand and a whole skate community called Virginia Avenue <br>
             (commonly referred to as Virginia Ave). He is one of the most cultured and fashionable people I know, so it was a pleasure to be able to connect with him again. <br>
             I used my dad’s old camera and took photos in the Turner Ave parking garage on Mizzou’s campus.
        </p>
        <p class="reflectiontext">

             I started an Instagram right after that shoot. He asked me how much for the photos and I told him I didn’t want money - I countered and asked to make and run an Instagram <br>
             account for his brand instead. It was called virginiaavemedia until recently - my username now is mybloodyvirginiaave, inspired by the Irish shoegaze band, ‘my bloody valentine’. <br>
             Since I made this account in November to showcase my photo design and members of the Virginia Ave community, I have found friends in local artists, skaters, designers, <br>
             and musicians around Mizzou and subcultures of Columbia. The feeling of community and belonging is overwhelming, and I have my camera, friends, and Instagram account <br>
             to thank for that. I’m very grateful for finding my way back to photos after feeling hopeless and out of touch with my desire to be a content creator. <br>
        </p>

        <p class="reflectiontext">
            I love photos because they’re so accessible - there’s no barrier to understanding and interpreting them. Social media apps have made photography one of the most <br>
            accessible mediums. Through my personal struggle to find something I love doing, my outlook on life and content creation has done a complete 180. Anything is <br>
            possible with the things you already have and the with people around you!</p>
